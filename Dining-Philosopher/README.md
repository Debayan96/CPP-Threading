Implement the dining philosophers problem.
There are N philosophers sitting in a round table.
A philosopher has 1 spork in their left and 1 spork in their right.
They will need to use both the sporks in their left and right for eating.
If any one of the sporks are unavailable they will keep waiting until both of them are available.

After they are done eating the philosopher will release their sporks and start thinking.
They will think and eat in an infinite loop.
